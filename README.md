# SV-DRR: High-Fidelity Novel View X-Ray Synthesis Using Diffusion Model
MICCAI 2025

We propose a novel view-conditioned diffusion model for synthesizing
multi-view X-ray images from a single view.

The name SV-DRR, short for Single-View DRR, is inspired by Digitally Reconstructed Radiography (DRR).

Unlike DRR, which renders X-ray projections from a 3D CT volume, our method synthesizes novel views directly from a single 2D projection.
